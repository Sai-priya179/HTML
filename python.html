<font size="6"><b><p><i>Python</i></b> is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.</p></font>

<font size="6"><p><b>Python</b> is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a <b><i>"batteries included"</i></b> language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p></font>

Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.</p></font>
