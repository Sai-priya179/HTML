<font size="6"><p><b><i>C++</b></i> (<i>/ˈsiː plʌs plʌs/</i>, pronounced <b><i>"C plus plus"</i></b> and sometimes abbreviated as <b><i>CPP</i></b>) is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by <b>Danish computer scientist</b> <font size="6.5" color=cyan><b><i><u>Bjarne Stroustrup</font></b></i></u>. First released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language, it has since expanded significantly over time; as of 1997, C++ has object-oriented, generic, and functional features, in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation for systems like microcomputers or to make operating systems like Linux or Windows. It is usually implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the <b>Free Software Foundation</b>, <b>LLVM</b>, <b>Microsoft</b>, <b>Intel</b>, <b>Embarcadero</b>, <b>Oracle</b>, and <b>IBM</b>.</p></font>
<font size="6"><p><b>C++</b> was designed with systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems in mind, with <b>performance</b>, <b>efficiency</b>, and <b>flexibility</b> of use as its design highlights.[15] C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications,[15] including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g., e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g., telephone switches or space probes).</p></font>
